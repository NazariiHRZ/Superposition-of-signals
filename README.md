# Superposition-of-signals
This script provides the ability to use matlab software to create a sinusoidal signal and add harmonics to it to obtain a mender-type signal with noise. Step-by-step reproduction of this script makes it possible to understand how different signals are superimposed during superposition.

**Version 2**
A part of the FFT has been added to the code, which demonstrates the possibility of analyzing the spectrum of the received signal using the discrete Fourier transform.
